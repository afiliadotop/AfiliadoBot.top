API Calling Process
Shopee Affiliate Open API platform USES the GraphQL specification to handle requests.
GraphQL is based on the HTTP protocol, so it's easy to integrate with various HTTP libraries like cURL and Requests. There are also a variety of open source clients to choose from https://graphql.org/code/#graphql-clients.
For more specifications on GraphQL, please refer to https://graphql.org/.
Authentication
All requests use authorization headers to provide authentication information. For details, please refer to #Authentication.
Rate Limit
The system limits the number of API calls issued within a specified time period. The current system limit is 8000 times/hour.
If the limit is exceeded, the system will refuse to process the request. The client needs to wait for the next time window to resend the request.
Timestamp and Timezone
Shopee is using local time in UTC+ time format for each local region to store the data.
But regardless of your timezone, a timestamp represents a moment that is the same everywhere.
Get Timestamp here for Shopee Open API platform.
Important notesMust Read
Scrollid
If you need to query multiple pages of data, you need to Query Twice or more!
The first query can get the content of the first page and scrollid, and the maximum number of data returned per page is 500.
Scrollid is used to help query the content of the second page and later. In order to get the content of the second page and later you Must Query with Scrollid.
Scrollid is one-time valid, the valid time is only 30 seconds.
So after the first request for scrollid, please query the content of the second and later page within 30 seconds.
The query without scrollid requires an interval of longer than 30 seconds.
Queryable Time range of conversion report
The available querying data time range is Recent 3 Months.
The time range that can be queried in the Open API is consistent with the time range of affiliate system portal.
If you query longer than the range, system will send error.
Authentication
Overview
All requests provide authentication information through the Authorization Header.

Authentication header structure
Authorization: SHA256 Credentials={Appid}, Timestamp={Timestamp}, Signature={Calculation method:SHA256(Credential+Timestamp+Payload+Secret}
Example Of Authorization Header
Authorization: SHA256 Credential=123456, Timestamp=1599999999, Signature=9bc0bd3ba6c41d98a591976bf95db97a58720a9e6d778845408765c3fafad69d.
Description of all parts of Authorization header
Component
Description
SHA256	The algorithm used to calculate the signature, currently only supports SHA256.
Credential	The Open API appId obtained from the affiliate platform is used to identify the request identity and calculate the signature.
Timestamp	The difference between the timestamp of the request and the server time cannot exceed 10 minutes,
so please ensure that the time of the machine that initiated the request is accurate. Used to calculate the signature.
Signature	Represented as a 256-bit signature of 64 lowercase hexadecimal characters.
Calculation method:SHA256(Credential+Timestamp+Payload+Secret)
Signature Calculation
Before sending a request, please obtain the AppId and Secret from here. (Please keep the secret equivalent to the password, don’t disclose it.)
Calculation Steps
Get the payload of the request, payload is a request body
{"query":"{\nbrandOffer{\n    nodes{\n        commissionRate\n        offerName\n    }\n}\n}"}
According to GraphQL standard, the request body must be in a valid JSON format.
When query by string conditions we should escape double quotes first. Like this,
{"query":"{conversionReport(purchaseTimeStart: 1600621200, purchaseTimeEnd: 1601225999, scrollId: "some characters"){...}}
Get the current timestamp
Construct a signature factor. Compose a string with AppId+Timestamp+Payload+Secret
Perform the SHA256 algorithm on the signature factor, signature=SHA256(Credential+Timestamp+Payload+Secret) to get the signature (lowercase hexadecimal)
Generate Authorization header: SHA256 Credential=${AppId}, Timestamp=${Timestamp}, Signature=${signature}
Example

Hypothesis AppId=123456, Secret=demo,
Current time=2020-01-01 00:00:00 UTC+0, Timestamp=1577836800,
Please send payload as

{"query":"{\nbrandOffer{\n    nodes{\n        commissionRate\n        offerName\n    }\n}\n}"}
Get the payload of the request
Get the current timestamp
Construct a signature factor: AppId+Timestamp+Payload+Sercet
  
Calculate the signature
signature=sha256(factor)，result should be dc88d72feea70c80c52c3399751a7d34966763f51a7f056aa070a5e9df645412
Generate Authorization header
Authorization:SHA256 Credential=123456, 
Timestamp=1577836800,Signature=dc88d72feea70c80c52c3399751a7d34966763f51a7f056aa070a5e9df645412
